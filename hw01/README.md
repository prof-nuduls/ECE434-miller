# HW01 Etch-a-Sketch

## Derick Miller 

> I created Etch-a-Sketch using the python curses library. There is a welcome page, that explain the instructions, a prompt to select canvas size, and then the game starts.

### How to play:
***
* Select a canvas size by inputing a single integer and clicking enter e.g. 8 = 8x8
* Control cursor by using arrow keys
* Clear screen by pressing "c"
* Quit game by pressing "q"
